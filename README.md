# WPWatcher
WordPress Watcher is a Python wrapper for [WPScan](http://wpscan.org/) that manages scans on multiple sites and reports by email

## In a Nutshell

  - Scan multiple sites with WPScan
  - Define reporting emails addresses for every configured site individually and globally
  - Mail messages are divided in "Warnings", "Alerts", "Informations" and eventually "Errors"
  - Mail notification and verbosity can be configred in config file 
  - Local log file can be configured and also lists all the findings 
  - Define false positives strings for every configured site individually and globally
  - Define WPScan arguments for every configured site individually and globally
  - Parse the results differently whether wpscan argument `--format` is `json` or `cli`

## Prerequisites 

  - [WPScan](http://wpscan.org/) (itself requires Ruby and some libraries).   
  - Python 3 (standard libraries)

## Usage

  1. Save script on server system
  2. Save template config file and configure script
  3. Configure cron to run WPWatcher frequently
  4. Configure email alerting to administrators if script fails.

    $ python3 ./wpwatcher.py
    # or
    $ python3 ./wpwatcher.py --conf ~/configs/wpwatcher.conf

Return non zero status code if :
- one or more WPScan command failed
- unable to send one or more email report
- other errors

#### Notes

- Will automatically delete all temp wpscan files in `/tmp/wpscan` before starting
- Set "--format","json" in  `wpscan_args` config option to have more consice email output

## Compatibility

Tested with WPScan 3.7 on :
- MacOS (WPScan install wil `HomeBrew`) and 
- Linux CentOS 7 (WPScan installed with `RubyGems`)

## Configuration

If not specified with `--conf <path>` script parameter, will try to load `./wpwatcher.conf` or `~/wpwatcher.conf` by default.

All options can be missing from config file expect `wp_sites`

#### Basic usage

Template configuration file.

```ini
[wpwatcher]
wpscan_path=wpscan
wp_sites=   [ {"url":"exemple.com"},
              {"url":"exemple2.com"}  ]
send_email_report=Yes
email_to=["me@exemple.com"]
smtp_server=mailserver.exemple.com:25
from_email=WordPressWatcher@exemple.com
```

#### Full configuration options
Listed below all configuration options. 
```ini
[wpwatcher]

# Assume wpscan is in you path by default
wpscan_path=wpscan

# Monitored sites, custom email report recepients, false positives and specific wpscan arguments
# Must be a valid Json string
# Each dictrionnary must contain at least a "url" key
wp_sites=   [
        {   
            "url":"exemple.com",
            "email_to":["site_owner@domain.com"],
            "false_positive_strings":["Vulnerability 123"],
            "wpscan_args":["--stealthy"]
        },

        }
    ]

# Global false positive strings
# Must be a valid Json string
# You can use this to ignore some warnmings or alerts.
# False positives will still be processed as infos
# Use with care
false_positive_strings=["You can get a free API token with 50 daily requests by registering at https://wpvulndb.com/users/sign_up"]

# Global WPScan arguments.
# Must be a valid Json string
#
# Set "--format","json" to use Json parsing feature
# The list of warnings, alerts and infos might differ when using json 
#   The outpout is more concice. 
#   But not all informations are logged. 
# Using "--format", "cli" will parse full WPScan output with [!] etc
#   Logs all informations
wpscan_args=[   "--format", "cli",
                "--no-banner",
                "--random-user-agent", 
                "--disable-tls-checks" ]

# Whether to send emails

# Whether to send warnings. 
# If not, will not send WARNING notifications and will not include warnings in ALERT reports
send_warnings=Yes

# Wheter to include Informations in the reports
# Reports will be sent every time
send_infos=No

# Will send emails even if wpscan exited with non zero status code
send_errors=No

# Global email report recepients, will always receive email reports for all sites
# Must be a valid Json string
